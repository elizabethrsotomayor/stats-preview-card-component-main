## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to set background images on divs using a linear gradient and fit the image to size using the background-size and object-fit properties.

### Continued development

I would like to learn how to make one class for both the mobile and desktop versions of the image to be able to dynamically change the url of the background image without affecting the linear gradient. Manually setting the height on the mobile image made me think that there must be an alternative way to achieve the same effect without using a random value.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Resizing background images with background-size](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Backgrounds_and_Borders/Resizing_background_images) - Examples of the background-size property and its effects
